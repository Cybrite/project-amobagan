- Product images and market information
- Data quality indicators

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

1. OVERALL HEALTH ASSESSMENT

A. Product Health Grade (A-E Scale)
- Extract the Nutri-Score grade from health_scoring.nutriscore.grade
- Explain the grading system: A (best) to E (worst)
- Provide context: "This product scores [grade] out of 5 possible grades"
- Score interpretation:
  A: Excellent nutritional quality
  B: Good nutritional quality
  C: Fair nutritional quality
  D: Poor nutritional quality
  E: Very poor nutritional quality

B. Overall Health Rating
Create a comprehensive health rating considering:
- Nutri-Score
- Nutrient level warnings
- Processing level
- Health risk factors

2. MAJOR HEALTH ALERTS

A. Critical Health Warnings
For each major health condition, analyze and provide alerts:

DIABETES RISK ASSESSMENT
- Sugar content analysis: Compare nutritional_information.per_100g.sugars to WHO recommendations (25g daily)
- Risk levels:
  LOW: <5g sugar per 100g
  MODERATE: 5-15g sugar per 100g
  HIGH: 15-25g sugar per 100g
  CRITICAL: >25g sugar per 100g
- Alert format: "DIABETES ALERT: [RISK LEVEL] - Contains [X]g sugar per 100g"

CARDIOVASCULAR RISK ASSESSMENT
- Saturated fat analysis: Compare to recommended <10% of daily calories
- Sodium analysis: Compare to recommended <2.3g daily
- Risk levels:
  LOW: <3g saturated fat per 100g, <0.3g sodium
  MODERATE: 3-10g saturated fat, 0.3-0.6g sodium
  HIGH: 10-20g saturated fat, 0.6-1.0g sodium
  CRITICAL: >20g saturated fat, >1.0g sodium
- Alert format: "HEART HEALTH ALERT: [RISK LEVEL] - High in saturated fat ([X]g) and/or sodium ([X]g)"

CANCER RISK ASSESSMENT
- Processing level: Analyze ultra-processed food indicators
- Additives concern: Flag if ingredients data unavailable
- Risk factors: High sugar, processed meat, additives
- Alert format: "CANCER RISK: [LEVEL] - [Specific concerns based on available data]"

OBESITY RISK ASSESSMENT
- Caloric density: Analyze calories per 100g
- Risk levels:
  LOW: <150 kcal per 100g
  MODERATE: 150-300 kcal per 100g
  HIGH: 300-500 kcal per 100g
  CRITICAL: >500 kcal per 100g
- Alert format: "WEIGHT GAIN RISK: [LEVEL] - High caloric density ([X] kcal per 100g)"

3. SERVING SIZE ANALYSIS

A. Realistic Serving Assessment
- Compare actual serving (per_serving.serving_size) with recommended portions
- Calculate per-serving impact:
  Calories per serving
  Sugar per serving vs. daily limit
  Saturated fat per serving vs. daily limit
  Sodium per serving vs. daily limit

B. Safe Consumption Limits
- Daily safe amount: Calculate based on nutritional guidelines
- Weekly limits: Multiply daily safe amount by 7
- Frequency recommendations:
  Daily: For healthy foods (A-B grade)
  2-3 times/week: For moderate foods (C grade)
  Weekly: For poor foods (D grade)
  Occasional treat: For very poor foods (E grade)

4. PROCESSING LEVEL ANALYSIS

A. NOVA Classification Assessment
- Extract processing level from processing_classification
- Processing categories:
  Group 1: Unprocessed/minimally processed
  Group 2: Processed culinary ingredients
  Group 3: Processed foods
  Group 4: Ultra-processed foods
- Health implications: Higher processing = higher health risks

B. Additives and Preservatives
- Flag missing ingredient data if unavailable
- General ultra-processed concerns: Artificial colors, flavors, preservatives
- Recommendation: "Ingredient analysis needed for complete assessment"

5. NUTRIENT-BY-NUTRIENT BREAKDOWN

A. Energy Analysis
- Caloric content: Per 100g and per serving
- Energy density category: Low (<100), Moderate (100-300), High (300-500), Very High (>500)
- Daily calorie contribution: Calculate percentage of 2000-calorie diet

B. Macronutrient Analysis
For each macronutrient, provide:
- Absolute amounts (per 100g and per serving)
- Percentage of daily recommended intake
- Health implications of the levels found
- Comparison to category averages if available

Fat Analysis
- Total fat: Categorize as low/moderate/high
- Saturated fat: Flag if >5g per 100g (high)
- Trans fat: Note if data missing/unavailable

Carbohydrate Analysis
- Total carbohydrates: Assess proportion
- Sugar content: Critical analysis for diabetes risk
- Fiber content: Note if missing (important for health)

Protein Analysis
- Protein content: Assess adequacy
- Protein quality: Limited without amino acid profile

C. Micronutrient Assessment
- Sodium/Salt: Critical for hypertension risk
- Other minerals: Note what's missing from analysis

6. POPULATION-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS
